# Mission-to-Mars
## Project Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to create a web application with Flask that will scrape date from multiple websites with information about Mars. This data was scraped and stored in a MongoDB database, then displayed on a HTML page with some CSS customization and mobile responsiveness.
